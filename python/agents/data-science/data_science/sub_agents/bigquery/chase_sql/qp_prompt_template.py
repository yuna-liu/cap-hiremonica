"""Query Plan (QP) prompt template."""

QP_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an experienced database expert.
Now you need to generate a GoogleSQL or BigQuery query given the database information, a question and some additional information.
The database structure is defined by table schemas (some columns provide additional column descriptions in the options).

Given the table schema information description and the `Question`. You will be given table creation statements and you need understand the database and columns.

You will be using a way called "Query Plan Guided SQL Generation" to generate the SQL query. This method involves breaking down the question into smaller sub-questions and then assembling them to form the final SQL query. This approach helps in understanding the question requirements and structuring the SQL query efficiently.

Database admin instructions (please *unconditionally* follow these instructions. Do *not* ignore them or use them as hints.):
1. **SELECT Clause:**
   - Select only the necessary columns by explicitly specifying them in the `SELECT` statement. Avoid redundant columns or values.

2. **Aggregation (MAX/MIN):**
   - Ensure `JOIN`s are completed before applying `MAX()` or `MIN()`. GoogleSQL supports similar syntax for aggregation functions, so use `MAX()` and `MIN()` as needed after `JOIN` operations.

3. **ORDER BY with Distinct Values:**
   - In GoogleSQL, `GROUP BY <column>` can be used before `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC` to get distinct values and sort them.

4. **Handling NULLs:**
   - To filter out NULL values, use `JOIN` or add a `WHERE <column> IS NOT NULL` clause.

5. **FROM/JOIN Clauses:**
   - Only include tables essential to the query. BigQuery supports `JOIN` types like `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`, so use these based on the relationships needed.

6. **Strictly Follow Hints:**
   - Carefully adhere to any specified conditions in the instructions for precise query construction.

7. **Thorough Question Analysis:**
   - Review all specified conditions or constraints in the question to ensure they are fully addressed in the query.

8. **DISTINCT Keyword:**
   - Use `SELECT DISTINCT` when unique values are needed, such as for IDs or URLs.

9. **Column Selection:**
   - Pay close attention to column descriptions and any hints to select the correct column, especially when similar columns exist across tables.

10. **String Concatenation:**
   - GoogleSQL uses `CONCAT()` for string concatenation. Avoid using `||` and instead use `CONCAT(column1, ' ', column2)` for concatenation.

11. **JOIN Preference:**
   - Use `INNER JOIN` when appropriate, and avoid nested `SELECT` statements if a `JOIN` will achieve the same result.

12. **GoogleSQL Functions Only:**
   - Use functions available in GoogleSQL. Avoid SQLite-specific functions and replace them with GoogleSQL equivalents (e.g., `FORMAT_DATE` instead of `STRFTIME`).

13. **Date Processing:**
   - GoogleSQL supports `FORMAT_DATE('%Y', date_column)` for extracting the year. Use date functions like `FORMAT_DATE`, `DATE_SUB`, and `DATE_DIFF` for date manipulation.

14. **Table Names and reference:**
   - As required by BigQuery, always use the full table name with the database prefix in the SQL statement. For example, "SELECT * FROM example_bigquery_database.table_a", not just "SELECT * FROM table_a"

15. **GROUP BY or AGGREGATE:**
   - In queries with GROUP BY, all columns in the SELECT list must either: Be included in the GROUP BY clause, or Be used in an aggregate function (e.g., MAX, MIN, AVG, COUNT, SUM).

Here are some examples

**Question**: How many Thai restaurants can be found in San Pablo Ave, Albany? Thai restaurant refers to food_type = 'thai'; San Pablo Ave Albany refers to street_name = 'san pablo ave' AND T1.city = 'albany'


**Query Plan**:

** Preparation Steps:**
1. Initialize the process: Start preparing to execute the query.
2. Prepare storage: Set up storage space (registers) to hold temporary results, initializing them to NULL.
3. Open the location table: Open the location table so we can read from it.
4. Open the generalinfo table: Open the generalinfo table so we can read from it.

** Matching Restaurants:**
1. Start reading the location table: Move to the first row in the location table.
2. Check if the street matches: Look at the street_name column of the current row in location. If it’s not "san pablo ave," skip this row.
3. Identify the matching row: Store the identifier (row ID) of this location entry.
4. Find the corresponding row in generalinfo: Use the row ID from location to directly find the matching row in generalinfo.
5. Check if the food type matches: Look at the food_type column in generalinfo. If it’s not "thai," skip this row.
6. Check if the city matches: Look at the city column in generalinfo. If it’s not "albany," skip this row.

** Counting Restaurants:**
1. Prepare to count this match: If all checks pass, prepare to include this row in the final count.
2. Count this match: Increment the count for each row that meets all the criteria.
3. Move to the next row in location: Go back to the location table and move to the next row, repeating the process until all rows are checked.
4. Finalize the count: Once all rows have been checked, finalize the count of matching rows.
5. Prepare the result: Copy the final count to prepare it for output.

** Delivering the Result:**
1. Output the result: Output the final count, which is the number of restaurants that match all the specified criteria.
2. End the process: Stop the query execution process.
3. Setup phase: Before starting the actual query execution, the system prepares the specific values it will be looking for, like "san pablo ave," "thai," and "albany."

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(T1.id_restaurant)
 FROM `{BQ_DATA_PROJECT_ID}`.restaurant.generalinfo AS T1
 INNER JOIN `{BQ_DATA_PROJECT_ID}`.restaurant.location AS T2 ON T1.id_restaurant = T2.id_restaurant
 WHERE T1.food_type = 'thai' AND T1.city = 'albany' AND T2.street_name = 'san pablo ave'

**Query Plan**:

** Preparation Steps: **
1. Initialize the process: Begin setting up the necessary environment to execute the query efficiently.
2. Open required tables: Access the client, account, and district tables to retrieve relevant data.
3. Prepare temporary storage: Allocate space to store intermediate results such as the lowest average salary and corresponding district information.

** Identify the Branch with Lowest Average Salary: **
1. Scan the district table: Retrieve all records from the district table to analyze average salaries.
2. Extract average salaries: For each district, note the value in the A11 column, which represents the average salary.
3. Determine the lowest salary: Compare all extracted average salaries to identify the minimum value.
4. Store corresponding district_id: Record the district_id associated with the lowest average salary for further processing.

** Find Clients in the Identified District: **
1. Join client and account tables: Merge records where client.client_id matches account.account_id to associate clients with their accounts.
2. Filter by district_id: Select only those records where account.district_id matches the previously identified district_id with the lowest average salary.
3. Handle potential duplicates: Ensure that each client is uniquely identified even if they have multiple accounts in the same district.

** Identify the Youngest Client: **
1. Extract birth dates: From the filtered client records, retrieve the birth_date for each client.
2. Determine the latest birth date: Identify the most recent (latest) birth date, indicating the youngest client among the filtered list.
3. Handle ties in birth dates: If multiple clients share the same latest birth date, prepare to handle multiple results or decide on additional criteria to select a single client.

** Retrieve Gender Information: **
1. Select the gender column: From the record(s) of the youngest client(s), extract the value in the gender column.
2. Prepare the result: Format the retrieved gender information for presentation, ensuring clarity and correctness.

** Finalize and Deliver the Result: **
1. Compile the final result: Organize the extracted gender information into a coherent and understandable output.
2. Clean up resources: Close any open table connections and release temporary storage used during query execution.
3. Output the result: Present the gender of the youngest client who opened an account in the branch with the lowest average salary.

** Query Plan**:

**  Preparation Steps : **
1. Initialize the process: Set up the environment and prepare for query execution, including initializing variables and temporary storage.
2. Open the symptom_search_sub_region_2_daily table: Access the table containing daily symptom search data.

** Extract the headache symptom: **
1. Scan the table: Start reading rows from the symptom_search_sub_region_2_daily table.
2. Identify the headache symptom: Look for the column containing the headache symptom data.
3. Extract the headache symptom value: For each row, extract the value from the headache symptom column.
4. Aggregate by date: Group the data by date to count the occurrences of the headache symptom on each day.

** Sort by frequency: **
1. Order the results in descending order of symptom frequency.
2. Limit the results: Extract the single day with the highest count.

** Step 2: Identify Subtasks **
1. Extract relevant symptom column: While "headache" is not explicitly listed, its frequency might be tracked in a related table (e.g., symptom_search_country_daily) as per the given gold query.
2. Group data by day of the week: Use FORMAT_DATE('%A', date) to extract the day of the week from each date.
3. Aggregate by count: Count the occurrences of the "headache" symptom across dates and group by the day of the week.
4. Sort by frequency: Order the results in descending order of symptom frequency.
5. Limit the results: Extract the single day with the highest count.

** Step 3: Formulate the Query **
1. From the subtasks, the query will:
2. Select the day of the week using FORMAT_DATE('%A', date).
3. Aggregate counts grouped by the day.
4. Sort the results by the aggregated count in descending order.
5. Limit the results to the top record.

** Step 4: Construct the Query **
1. Combining all subtasks, the final query is:
2. SELECT COUNT(symptom_headache) FROM `{BQ_DATA_PROJECT_ID}`.covid19_symptom_search.symptom_search_sub_region_2_daily GROUP BY FORMAT_DATE('%A', date) ORDER BY COUNT(symptom_headache) DESC LIMIT 1;

** Step 5: Finalize the Query **
**Final Optimized SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%A', PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d', date)) AS day,
  COUNT(*) AS headache_count
FROM
  `{BQ_DATA_PROJECT_ID}`.covid19_symptom_search.symptom_search_country_daily
GROUP BY
  day
ORDER BY
  headache_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Now is the real question, following the instruction and examples, generate the GoogleSQL with Recursive Divide-and-Conquer approach.
Follow all steps from the strategy. When you get to the final query, output the query string ONLY in the format ```sql ... ```. Make sure you only output one single query.
