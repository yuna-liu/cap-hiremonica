# Gemini Fullstack Agent Development Kit (ADK) Quickstart

The **Gemini Fullstack Agent Development Kit (ADK) Quickstart** is a production-ready blueprint for building a sophisticated, fullstack research agent with Gemini. It's built to demonstrate how the ADK helps structure complex agentic workflows, build modular agents, and incorporate critical Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) steps.

This project adapts concepts from the [Gemini FullStack LangGraph Quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart) for the frontend app. 

## üöÄ Getting Started: From Zero to Running Agent in 1 Minute
**Prerequisites:** **[Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**, **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**, **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**

You have two options to get started. Choose the one that best fits your setup:

*   A. **[Google AI Studio](#a-google-ai-studio)**: Choose this path if you want to use a **Google AI Studio API key**. This method involves cloning the sample repository.
*   B. **[Google Cloud Vertex AI](#b-google-cloud-vertex-ai)**: Choose this path if you want to use an existing **Google Cloud project** for authentication. This method generates a new, prod-ready project using the [agent-starter-pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) including all the deployment scripts required.

---

### A. Google AI Studio

You'll need a **[Google AI Studio API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)**.

#### Step 1: Clone Repository
Clone the repository and `cd` into the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/adk-samples.git
cd adk-samples/python/agents/gemini-fullstack
```

#### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `app` folder by running the following command (replace YOUR_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY with your actual API key):

```bash
echo "GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE" >> app/.env
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY" >> app/.env
```

#### Step 3: Install & Run
From the `gemini-fullstack` directory, install dependencies and start the servers.

```bash
make install && make dev
```
Your agent is now running at `http://localhost:5173`.

---

### B. Google Cloud Vertex AI

You'll also need: **[Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)** and a **Google Cloud Project** with the **Vertex AI API** enabled.

#### Step 1: Create Project from Template
This command uses the [Agent Starter Pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) to create a new directory (`my-fullstack-agent`) with all the necessary code.
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the starter pack and create your project
pip install --upgrade agent-starter-pack
agent-starter-pack create my-fullstack-agent -a adk@gemini-fullstack
```
<details>
<summary>‚ö°Ô∏è Alternative: Using uv</summary>

If you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, you can create and set up your project with a single command:
```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create my-fullstack-agent -a adk@gemini-fullstack
```
This command handles creating the project without needing to pre-install the package into a virtual environment.
</details>

You'll be prompted to select a deployment option (Agent Engine or Cloud Run) and verify your Google Cloud credentials.

#### Step 2: Install & Run
Navigate into your **newly created project folder**, then install dependencies and start the servers.
```bash
cd my-fullstack-agent && make install && make dev
```
Your agent is now running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment
> **Note:** The cloud deployment instructions below apply only if you chose the **Google Cloud Vertex AI** option.

You can quickly deploy your agent to a **development environment** on Google Cloud. You can deploy your latest code at any time with:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_DEV_PROJECT_ID with your actual Google Cloud Project ID
gcloud config set project YOUR_DEV_PROJECT_ID
make backend
```

## How the Agent Thinks: A Two-Phase Workflow

The backend agent, defined in `app/agent.py`, follows a sophisticated workflow to move from a simple topic to a fully-researched report.

The following diagram illustrates the agent's architecture and workflow:

![ADK Gemini Fullstack Architecture](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/agent-starter-pack/blob/main/docs/images/adk_gemini_fullstack_architecture.png?raw=true)

This process is broken into two main phases:

### Phase 1: Plan & Refine (Human-in-the-Loop)

This is the collaborative brainstorming phase.

1.  **You provide a research topic.**
2.  The agent generates a high-level research plan with several key goals (e.g., "Analyze the market impact," "Identify key competitors").
3.  The plan is presented to **you**. You can approve it, or chat with the agent to add, remove, or change goals until you're satisfied. Nothing happens without your explicit approval.

The plan will contains following tags as a signal to downstream agents,
  - Research Plan Tags

    - [RESEARCH]: Guides info gathering via search.
    - [DELIVERABLE]: Guides creation of final outputs (e.g., tables, reports).
  
  - Plan Refinement Tags

    - [MODIFIED]: Goal was updated.
    - [NEW]: New goal added per user.
    - [IMPLIED]: Deliverable proactively added by AI.

### Phase 2: Execute Autonomous Research

Once you approve the plan, the agent's `research_pipeline` takes over and works autonomously.

1.  **Outlining:** It first converts the approved plan into a structured report outline (like a table of contents).
2.  **Iterative Research & Critique Loop:** For each section of the outline, it repeats a cycle:
    *   **Search:** It performs web searches to gather information.
    *   **Critique:** A "critic" model evaluates the findings for gaps or weaknesses.
    *   **Refine:** If the critique finds weaknesses, the agent generates more specific follow-up questions and searches again. This loop continues until the research meets a high-quality bar.
3.  **Compose Final Report:** After the research loop is complete, a final agent takes all the verified findings and writes a polished report, automatically adding inline citations that link back to the original sources.

You can edit key parameters (Gemini models, research loop iterations) in the `ResearchConfiguration` dataclass within `app/config.py`.

## Customization

You can modify and extend this agent's behavior by editing the backend code.

*   **Modifying Agent Logic:** The core logic for all sub-agents (planner, researcher, critic, composer) is defined in `app/agent.py`. You can change the prompts, tools, or reasoning steps by modifying the agent definitions here.
*   **Adjusting Research Parameters:** Key parameters, such as the Gemini models used or the number of research loop iterations, can be adjusted in the `ResearchConfiguration` dataclass within `app/config.py`.
*   **Syncing with Frontend:** The frontend UI integrates with the backend through specific agent names that process outputs differently (e.g., research findings vs. final report), update the activity timeline with appropriate titles/icons, and track research metrics like website counts. 
    Important agent names include:
    * `section_researcher` & `enhanced_search_executor` - track websites consulted
    * `report_composer_with_citations` - processes final report
    * `interactive_planner_agent` - updates AI messages during planning
    * `plan_generator` and `section_planner` - used for timeline labels
    
    If you rename agents in `app/agent.py`, you must update their names in the frontend code (`/ui`) to maintain functionality.


### Example Interaction

> **User:** A report on the last Google I/O
>
> **Agent:** Here's a research plan for a report on the last Google I/O:
>
> *   Analyze the key announcements and product updates made at Google I/O 2025.
> *   Identify the central themes and strategic directions emphasized by Google during the event, particularly concerning AI, Android, and other emerging technologies like Android XR.
> *   Investigate the reception and industry impact of the major product unveilings and feature enhancements.
> *   Examine any significant shifts or continuities in Google's developer strategy as presented at the conference.
> *   Assess the implications of the announced technologies and initiatives for developers, consumers, and the broader tech landscape.
>
> Does this plan look good, or would you like to refine it further? Once approved, I can initiate the research.
>
> **User:** Looks good!
> *(The agent proceeds to autonomously execute the research, showing its progress on the timeline.)*
>
> **Agent:**
> 
> Google I/O 2025: Key Announcements and Highlights
> ....
