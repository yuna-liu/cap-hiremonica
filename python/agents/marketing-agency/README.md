# Marketing Agency


## Overview

This AI-powered assistant is engineered to enhance the capabilities of creative agencies when launching new websites or products. The process commences with an intelligent agent that guides users in selecting an optimal DNS domain, ensuring it aligns perfectly with the website's subject matter or the product's identity. Following this foundational step, another specialized agent takes over to facilitate the comprehensive creation of the entire website. Subsequently, a dedicated agent is deployed to generate a full suite of marketing materials. The workflow culminates with an agent focused on designing distinctive logos that are thematically consistent with the project's core topic. This multi-agent system aims to streamline and augment the creative output of the agency across the entire launch lifecycle.

## Running the Agent

**Using `adk`**

ADK provides convenient ways to bring up agents locally and interact with them.
You may talk to the agent using the CLI:

```bash
adk run marketing_agency
```

Or on a web interface:

```bash
 adk web
```

The command `adk web` will start a web server on your machine and print the URL.
You may open the URL, select "marketing_agency" in the top-left drop-down menu, and
a chatbot interface will appear on the right. The conversation is initially
blank. Here are some example requests you may ask the Marketing Agency to verify:

```
who are you
```

Sampled responses of these requrests are shown below in the [Example
Interaction](#example-interaction) section.

```

```

### Example Interaction

Below is an example interaction with the Marketing Agency. Note that the exact output
of the agent may be different every time.

```
user: who are you

I am a marketing expert, and my goal is to help you establish a powerful online presence and connect effectively with your audience. I will guide you through defining your digital identity, from choosing the perfect domain name and crafting a professional website, to strategizing online marketing campaigns, designing a memorable logo, and creating engaging short videos.

help me to find the perfect domain

Okay, I can help with that! To start, please tell me some keywords relevant to your brand. For example, if you're selling handmade jewelry, keywords might be "handmade," "jewelry," "artisan," "unique," "gifts."

user: i want to sell cakes organic cakes

Great! I'll use "organic" and "cakes" as keywords to find some domain name options for you.

domain_create_agent tool reported: {'result': '1. PureOrganicBakes.com\n2. EarthlyCakes.com\n3. Organocake.com\n4. FarmFreshCakes.com\n5. ArtisanOrganicCakes.com\n6. SimplyOrganicCakes.com\n7. TrueOrganicBaking.com\n8. GoldenOrganicCakes.com\n9. BloomOrganicCakes.com\n10. PetalOrganicCakes.com'}

Here are some available domain names based on your keywords:

PureOrganicBakes.com
EarthlyCakes.com
Organocake.com
FarmFreshCakes.com
ArtisanOrganicCakes.com
SimplyOrganicCakes.com
TrueOrganicBaking.com
GoldenOrganicCakes.com
BloomOrganicCakes.com
PetalOrganicCakes.com
Please review this list and let me know which domain name you'd like to choose.

user: let's go go 9 i love it

Excellent choice! "BloomOrganicCakes.com" sounds lovely.

Next, we'll move on to crafting a professional website for your chosen domain.

website_create_agent tool reported: {'result': "To proceed with website creation, please obtain the following missing essential information from the user:\n\n* Brand/Project Name (Please confirm if 'Bloom Organic Cakes', derived from the domain 'BloomOrganicCakes.com', is the correct brand name to be displayed. If not, please provide the official Brand/Project Name.)\n* Primary Goal/Purpose of the Website (e.g., 'Showcase handmade organic cakes and attract local customers,' 'Facilitate online orders and inquiries for custom organic cakes,' 'Build brand awareness for our organic bakery.')\n* Key services, products, or information to be featured (e.g., 'Specific types of cakes offered (wedding, birthday, cupcakes, vegan, gluten-free), information about organic ingredients, a gallery of cake designs, pricing tiers, how to order, baking philosophy.')"}

Before we can create the website, I need a little more information:

Brand/Project Name: Should we use "Bloom Organic Cakes" (derived from your domain) as the brand name displayed on the website, or do you have an official Brand/Project Name you'd prefer?
Primary Goal/Purpose of the Website: What is the main thing you want your website to achieve? For example, is it to showcase your cakes and attract local customers, to take online orders, or to build brand awareness?
Key services, products, or information to be featured: What are the most important things you want to highlight on your website? This could include specific types of cakes you offer (like wedding cakes, birthday cakes, cupcakes, vegan options, gluten-free options), details about your organic ingredients, a gallery of your cake designs, pricing information, how to order, or your baking philosophy.
Once I have these details, I can instruct the website creation tool.

The Brand is "Antonio's perfect cakes" the primary target is young generation for 20 years old and i need an image gallery and a shopping gallery

Okay, thank you for that information! So the brand name is "Antonio's perfect cakes," and the website should target a young audience (around 20 years old) and include an image gallery and a shopping gallery.

We'll use the domain "BloomOrganicCakes.com" as you selected earlier.

user: show me the answer detailed

user: key benefits is to have fresh ingredients and people are located in Europe, lifestyle is nomadic

Okay, "fresh ingredients" is a great benefit, and knowing the target audience is "nomadic" and located in "Europe" gives us more to work with for the 19-30 age group. This "nomadic lifestyle" is an interesting niche!

```

## Running Tests

For running tests and evaluation, install the extra dependencies:

```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

Then the tests and evaluation can be run from the `marketing_agency` directory using
the `pytest` module:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests
python3 -m pytest eval
```

`tests` runs the agent on a sample request, and makes sure that every component
is functional. `eval` is a demonstration of how to evaluate the agent, using the
`AgentEvaluator` in ADK. It sends a couple requests to the agent and expects
that the agent's responses match a pre-defined response reasonablly well.


## Deployment

The Marketing Agency can be deployed to Vertex AI Agent Engine using the following
commands:

```bash
poetry install --with deployment
python3 deployment/deploy.py --create
```

When the deployment finishes, it will print a line like this:

```
Created remote agent: projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/<PROJECT_LOCATION>/reasoningEngines/<AGENT_ENGINE_ID>
```

If you forgot the AGENT_ENGINE_ID, you can list existing agents using:

```bash
python3 deployment/deploy.py --list
```

The output will be like:

```
All remote agents:

123456789 ("marketing_agency")
- Create time: 2025-05-12 12:45:36.342561+00:00
- Update time: 2025-05-12 12:47:01.453252+00:00
```

You may interact with the deployed agent programmatically in Python:

You may interact with the deployed agent using the `test_deployment.py` script
```bash
$ export USER_ID=<any string>
$ python3 deployment/test_deployment.py --resource_id=${AGENT_ENGINE_ID} --user_id=${USER_ID}
Found agent with resource ID: ...
Created session for user ID: ...
Type 'quit' to exit.
Input: Hello. What can you do for me?

```

To delete the deployed agent, you may run the following command:

```bash
python3 deployment/deploy.py --delete --resource_id=${AGENT_ENGINE_ID}
```

## Customization

The Marketing Agency platform is designed with inherent flexibility, allowing for significant customization to align precisely with your unique operational requirements and marketing objectives. Its core capabilities can be substantially enhanced through targeted upgrades, for instance:

1. Upgrade DNS Suggestion with Real-time Availability Checks: The current DNS suggestion feature, while helpful, can be significantly improved by integrating real-time availability checks. This enhancement would ensure that any proposed domain names are instantly verified against existing registrations, eliminating the frustration of suggesting unavailable options. By providing immediate feedback on domain availability, the platform streamlines the website creation process, accelerates decision-making for clients, and enhances the overall efficiency of launching new online presences.

2. Implement Persistent Website Artifact Storage for Version Control and Archiving: To provide greater control, accountability, and flexibility, functionality can be added to save any generated website as a persistent digital artifact. This means the complete website structure, content, and assets would be securely stored and retrievable. This capability is crucial for enabling robust version control, allowing users to track changes over time, revert to previous iterations if needed, and maintain a clear history of development. Furthermore, it provides essential backup and archiving for future reference, auditing, or potential reuse, ensuring that valuable creative work is never lost.

3. Expand Media Creation Tools with Integrated Video Production (e.g., Veo Integration): To broaden the scope of marketing materials the platform can generate, the existing media creation tools can be significantly expanded to include video production capabilities. By integrating services like Veo, the agency would gain the ability to efficiently produce high-quality, short promotional videos, social media clips, or explainer content. This diversification into video marketing is critical in today's digital landscape, enabling the creation of more engaging, dynamic, and versatile marketing assets that can be utilized across various channels, from social media campaigns to website embeds, thereby greatly enhancing client reach and engagement.
