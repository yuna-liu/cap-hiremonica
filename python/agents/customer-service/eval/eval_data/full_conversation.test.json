    "reference": "That's a good question, Alex. The General Purpose Fertilizer you have in your cart (fert-456) can provide basic nutrients, but tomatoes, especially when they're struggling, often benefit from a fertilizer specifically formulated for them or for vegetables in general. These typically have a different balance of nutrients (like phosphorus and potassium) that encourage fruiting and overall plant health. \n Let me quickly check for specific recommendations for tomatoes."

    "reference": " Okay, Alex, I checked the recommendations for tomatoes, and interestingly, the system does list the General Purpose Fertilizer (fert-456) that's currently in your cart as suitable. It also recommended the Standard Potting Soil (soil-123), which you also have. \n So, according to our system, the fertilizer you have selected is considered appropriate for tomatoes. \n However, since you mentioned your tomatoes aren't looking healthy, it might be worth checking those care instructions I sent to see if they suggest a specific nutrient deficiency or issue. Sometimes, a more specialized vegetable or tomato fertilizer with a specific N-P-K ratio (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium) can give struggling plants a targeted boost that a general-purpose one might not provide as effectively. \n For now, the General Purpose Fertilizer is a reasonable choice based on our recommendations. Would you like to keep it in your cart, or would you like me to see if we have a more specialized tomato fertilizer available?"
